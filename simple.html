About GitHub CLI extensions

GitHub CLI extensions are custom GitHub CLI commands that anyone can create and use. 
For more information about how to use GitHub CLI extensions, see "Using GitHub CLI extensions."

You need a repository for each extension that you create. The repository name must start with gh-. 
The rest of the repository name is the name of the extension. At the root of the repository, 
there must be an executable file with the same name as the repository. 
This file will be executed when the extension is invoked.
